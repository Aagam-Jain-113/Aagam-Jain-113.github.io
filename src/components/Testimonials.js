                            <p className='mt-2 text-justify text-lg'>Aagam was a fantastic frontend developer when he worked with us at lemon8.in. He was very quick in implementing the UI in React and always accurately converted the UI design into responsive code without many intimations. Aagam was also able to smartly use third-party libraries and implement the dynamic creative aspects of the design. He always delivered on time, was punctual for our meetings and never wasted anyone's time. It was a pleasure to work with him, hopefully will work with him on more projects in the future ðŸ˜Š</p>
